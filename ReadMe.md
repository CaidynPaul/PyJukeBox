Instructions --

Play with Console
Playing without makes it really loud for some reason.  
Always put songs in Songs folder before playing.  
If you put songs whilst app is running press R or Click Reload button to refresh the programme.
This will lose progress within the song and will start from the first song.  
Do not Edit Code unless you know what you are doing.  
If you edit code and made a mistake redownload project from Github.
Avoid Really long file names.
